        <h3>Kurt Cobain</h3>
        <p>Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 â€“ April 5, 1994) was an American singer-songwriter
            and musician, best known as the guitarist, primary songwriter and frontman of the rock band Nirvana.
             Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona, Cobain's compositions widened
              the thematic conventions of mainstream rock music. He was often heralded as a spokesman of Generation 
              X and is considered to be one of the most influential musicians in the history of alternative rock.

        <h3>Musical style
        </h3>
        <p>Cobain described Nirvana's initial sound as "a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff".
            When Nirvana recorded Bleach, Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop
             grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound.
              Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad argued, "Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that
               helped the band find its musical identity." Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up 
               listening to Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, they had been able to move on from their derivative early sound.
